        "Mrs. Robinson’s 4th grade class took a field trip to the local zoo. The day was sunny and warm – a perfect day to spend at the zoo. The kids had a great time and the monkeys were voted the class favorite animal. The zoo had four monkeys – two males and two females. It was lunchtime for the monkeys and as the kids watched, each one ate a different fruit in their favorite resting place:\n",
