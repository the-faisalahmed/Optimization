The salesman took out his calculator, pressed a few buttons, and said: “The total price is $\\$7.11$.” “Why?” said the customer, who was amazed by this coincidence. “Do I have to pay $\\$7.11$ because the name of the shop is 7-Eleven?” “Of course not!” replied the salesman. “I have multiplied the prices of these four items and I have given you the result!” “Why did you multiply these numbers?” asked the surprised customer. “You should have added them to get the total price!” “Oh, yes, I’m sorry,” the salesman said. “I have a terrible headache and pressed the wrong button!” Then the salesman repeated all the calculations (i.e., he added the prices of these four items), but to both of their great surprise, the total was still $\\$7.11$. What are the prices of these four items? Believe it or not, there is a unique solution to this problem…”"
