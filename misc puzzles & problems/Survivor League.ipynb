    "A Survivor League (or Survivor Pool) in NFL is a type of elimination contest where participants pick one team each week that they believe will win their game. The goal is to remain in the pool as long as possible. Here’s how it typically works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One Pick per Week: Each participant selects one NFL team to win their game in a given week.\n",
    "2. Win or Eliminate: If the selected team wins, the participant survives and moves on to the next week. If the team loses (or ties, depending on the pool rules), the participant is eliminated.\n",
    "3. No Repeats: Once a team is picked, it can’t be chosen again for the rest of the season. This adds strategy, as participants need to consider future weeks when choosing which team to use.\n",
    "4. Last One Standing: The competition continues until only one person remains, who is then crowned the winner. If multiple participants make it through the entire season, tiebreakers are usually implemented, such as the total score of games in the final week.\n",
    "\n",
    "Survivor leagues are popular because of their simplicity and the strategic depth required to balance short-term gains and long-term survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem looks at the 2024 NFL schedule and considers weeks 2 - 18. To get the highest probability of winning every game, I used [this link](https://www.numberfire.com/nfl/survivor-pool-matrix) that tracks each team's probability of winning per week. Next, I scale the probabilities by a factor of 10 to ensure the values are integers allowing Google's OR-Tools to implement them in our model. Finally, we are looking to maximize the overall probability of winning throughout the 18 weeks."
