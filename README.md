# Optimization Projects
I've been very interested in optimization and am looking to expand my knowledge and expertise on the subject. My aim is to challenge myself with various types of optimization problems/puzzles and learn something new along the way.

## 1.  [**Numbrix**](https://github.com/the-faisalahmed/Optimization/blob/main/Numbrix_and_Hidato.ipynb)

Numbrix is a logic-based puzzle where players connect consecutive numbers in a grid, horizontally or vertically, with no diagonals, to form a continuous path.

## 2.  [**Hidato**](https://github.com/the-faisalahmed/Optimization/blob/main/Numbrix_and_Hidato.ipynb)

Hidato is a logic puzzle where players must fill a grid with consecutive numbers, starting from a given number and moving horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to adjacent, open cells to form a continuous path.

## 3.  [**Spot-It aka Dobble**](https://github.com/the-faisalahmed/Optimization/blob/main/Spot_It_Dobble.ipynb)

Spot-It aka Dobble employs prime number theory to ensure each pair of cards has exactly one matching symbol, making it a fast-paced game of pattern recognition.
